VS2015 & Qt4
============

# source

Download modified source that can be build with vs2015: <http://whudoc.qiniudn.com/2016/qt-src-4.8.7-vs2015.7z> (41.5 MB).
This is based on qt official release 4.8.7 (last qt4 release), and patched necessary modifications so that it can be
successfully compiled by vc14 (vs2015). The patch is offerred by [sandym/qt-patches](https://github.com/sandym/qt-patches).

# build

checkout my demo: **<http://whudoc.qiniudn.com/2016/vs2015-qt4-playground.zip>** (14 MB).

14 MB = 13.6 MB of qt4 prebuild (release version only, a tiny qt4!) + 1 demo qt project.
